**Usage**

1. Ensure that you have Python3 installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
git clone https://github.com/MohammadJavad-AsnaAshari/DNA-Search-With-LCS-Algorithm.git

3. Navigate to the project directory.
cd DNA Search With LCS Algorithm.

4. Run the "main.py" script by executing the following command:
python main.py

5. You will be prompted to enter a DNA sequence.
Enter a DNA:
Type in the DNA sequence you want to search for and press Enter.

6. If the files/file1.txt doesn't exist, it will be created, and the entered DNA sequence will be written to it.

7. If the files/file2.txt doesn't exist, you will be asked to enter the number of DNA sequences to generate. The generated sequences will be saved to files/file2.txt.

8. The script will compare the input DNA sequence with each sequence in files/file2.txt and find the most relevant match using the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm.

9. The results will be displayed in the console, including whether an exact match was found and the most relevant DNA sequence.

10. An output file named files/output.txt will be generated, containing the input DNA sequence, each sequence from files/file2.txt, and the LCS between them.

11. Finally, you will be prompted to clear the cache.
Do you want to clear the cache? (yes/no):
If you enter "yes," the files/file1.txt, files/file2.txt, and files/output.txt files will be deleted. If you enter "no," the cache will not be cleared.
